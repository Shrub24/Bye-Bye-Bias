PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush ' s National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has recently " defined " the context and scope of the term " axis of evil " that Bush used in his State of the Union address a few weeks ago to describe $T$ .
Iraq, Iran and North Korea
-1
$T$ is , in fact , the fear of all countries , as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction .
This
-1
The criteria set by Rice are the following : $T$ are repressive and grave human rights violators , and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction .
the three countries in question
-1
The mere development or possession of mass destruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label $T$ as evildoer .
a state
-1
It is not enough that he sees those countries as evil , he wants his allies to feel the same way about $T$ as well .
them
-1
In the presidential election , $T$ campaigned on economic and education issues and barely scraped through .
he
-1
As Bush has declared that $T$ are the " Axis of Evil , " it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons , be they chemical , biological , or nuclear .
Iraq, Iran, and North Korea
-1
The term " Axis of Evil " that President George W . Bush used to label $T$ has now become a hot , much - discussed phrase .
Iraq, Iran, and North Korea
-1
For the countries that regard the three countries as friends or not evil , $T$ are considered to be enemies of the United States .
they
-1
As reminder , former US President Ronald Reagan used to call $T$ " the Evil Empire . "
the Soviet Union
-1
Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser , the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are $T$ that are regarded as enemies of the United States .
the groups
-1
It is not enough that he sees $T$ as evil , he wants his allies to feel the same way about them as well .
those countries
-1
Whether a country agrees with and regardless of how it views the US policy , the United States is taking the direction that emphasizes its national security and confrontation with $T$ that Washington regards as enemies .
the countries
-1
Bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the adversarial US position toward $T$ that , according to Washington ' s claim , still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons .
the three countries
-1
Many believed that $T$ was naive about foreign affairs .
Bush
-1
$T$ deserves to be closely analyzed and monitored .
The new US policy
-1
For the countries that regard $T$ as friends or not evil , they are considered to be enemies of the United States .
the three countries
1
$T$ may result in more intense armed confrontation .
This
-1
It does not matter where in the world , he will vigorously hunt $T$ down if they are perceived to seek to target the United States .
terrorists
-1
$T$ may step up sabotage of US targets and the US allies .
The terrorist groups
-1
It does not matter where in the world , he will vigorously hunt terrorists down if they are perceived to seek to target $T$ .
the United States
-1
A close look will show that $T$ has already carried out this aggressive policy in abrupt and rapid manner without comprehensively consulting with the countries concerned .
the United States
-1
Bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the adversarial US position toward $T$ that , according to Washington ' s claim , still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons .
the three countries
-1
$T$ will consult with no one , not even its closest allies , whether in Europe or its followers in the Third World , particularly in the Arab world .
The current US administration
-1
At any rate , Secretary Powell ' s remark about the US administration ' s readiness to enter dialogue with $T$ and with Washington ' s friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions .
these "evil" states
1
Oddly enough , speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush ' s speech and his threats to " $T$ " like any other US citizen .
the axis of evil
-1
$T$ had not read the speech before President Bush delivered it , as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post .
He
-1
The United States is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies , the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby , which sees the world through the eyes of $T$ and his extremist government .
Ari'el Sharon
-1
$T$ simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment , because international economic prosperity can be built on stability , not wars .
This mentality
-1
$T$ is therefore planning to trigger wars here and there to revive the flagging arms industry .
He
-1
It lumped $T$ with Iran and Iraq as part of the " axis of evil " only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted .
North Korea
-1
$T$ simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment , because international economic prosperity can be built on stability , not wars .
This mentality
-1
A day after President Bush ' s threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction , Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that " characterizing $T$ as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them . "
these counties
-1
The United States is currently run by a typical $T$ , which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples .
