This is about the following : on 18 January 2002 , President Bush publicly announced two decisions , which , owing to the President ' s firmness in announcing them , seemed unyielding : first , the President said the 158 pro - Taliban fighters brought to Guantanamo Bay were not defined by US courts as prisoners of war ; therefore , the United States does not believe it is its duty to grant them prisoner - of - war rights under the Geneva Convention , $T$ regulates ( since 1949 ) the status of this category of detained combatants

The White House hastened to describe the Bush plan as " the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions , " considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $1 billion , compared to the costs that $T$ would lead to .
binding rules

Presented Thursday 14 February by President George W . Bush , this alternative plan for slowing down global warming moves away from the binding measures of implementation of $T$ , recently approved by more than 170 countries in Marrakech , but rejected in March 2001 by President Bush , who deemed it harmful to the US economy and reproached it for imposing constraints on industrialized countries only .

Contrary to the preceding one , $T$ Thursday thus no longer has any binding procedure and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives .

According to Steve Sawyer , one of Greenpeace International ' s climate experts , $T$ " will have very little effect on emissions , assuming it has any . "

EU

The EU is of the opinion that a cap - and - trade $T$ is a cost - effective measure to reduce emissions which combines a guaranteed environmental result with the flexibility to reduce emissions where it is least costly
system

Over the past years , greenhouse gas emissions $T$ in relation to GDP has been falling in the US

However , mandatory $T$ and reporting of emissions at company level would be necessary to adequately assess whether the proposals by President Bush represent an effort comparable to the ones under the Kyoto Protocol

$T$ is the ultimate objective of the Convention to which the US has subscribed

review

The Climate Change Convention of 1992 , to which the $T$ is a Party , requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels
US
0
By 2005 , the $T$ intends to implement a cap - and - trade system covering 46% of all CO2 emissions in 2010
EU
0
Current emission $T$ for the US indicate an increase of 39% above 1990 levels in 2012
projections
0
Achieving this would only be a first step towards stabilising global greenhouse gas concentrations at a level $T$ would prevent dangerous climate change
that
0
$T$ is striking that the approach which is considered beneficial for other air pollutants , namely to implement cap - and - trade programmes , is not extended to CO2 emissions from the power sector
It
0
$T$ may represent a first step in the right direction , where also economic operators in the US are asked to contribute to emission control .
The proposals by President Bush
0
On the contrary , $T$ requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions , while they still foresee to have growing economies .
the Kyoto Protocol
1
$T$ is based on a prolongation of this trend thereby in effect foreseeing little more than continuation on a " business - as - usual " path .
The Bush plan
-1
While $T$ may reduce this to around 33% , this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions .
the intensity improvements

$T$ allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change .

$T$ may represent a first step in the right direction , where also economic operators in the US are asked to contribute to emission control .
The proposals by President Bush
1
What is also realistic is the idea that $T$ will be easier to persuade the main polluting agents to take measures by providing incentives to them , rather than by constraint
it
0
The US President preferred $T$ , because it is hard to believe that it will be possible to fully eliminate pollutant gas emissions in one decade .
a more realistic attitude
1
Companies are urged in the proposed covenants to adopt measures $T$ have an economic cost recovery period of less than five years or have an internal rate of return greater than that of a straight - lined obligation
which
0
If industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years , $T$ will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector , services , households , and so forth
that
0
Because this debate has failed to take place , it is understandable that all sectors ( ranging from processing and manufacturing industrial sector , the electricity sector , the tertiary sector , and the transport sector to the residential sector ) are currently doing their utmost to make their own future $T$ as small ( yet acceptable ) as possible
efforts
0
Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard , on the condition that $T$ are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling
they
0
But $T$ is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency ( realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society )
