PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush ' s National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has recently " defined " the context and scope of the term " axis of evil " that Bush used in his State of the Union address a few weeks ago to describe $T$ .
Iraq, Iran and North Korea
-1
$T$ is , in fact , the fear of all countries , as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction .
This
-1
The criteria set by Rice are the following : $T$ are repressive and grave human rights violators , and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction .
the three countries in question
-1
The mere development or possession of mass destruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label $T$ as evildoer .
a state
-1
It is not enough that he sees those countries as evil , he wants his allies to feel the same way about $T$ as well .
them
-1
In the presidential election , $T$ campaigned on economic and education issues and barely scraped through .
he
-1
As Bush has declared that $T$ are the " Axis of Evil , " it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons , be they chemical , biological , or nuclear .
Iraq, Iran, and North Korea
-1
The term " Axis of Evil " that President George W . Bush used to label $T$ has now become a hot , much - discussed phrase .
Iraq, Iran, and North Korea
-1
For the countries that regard the three countries as friends or not evil , $T$ are considered to be enemies of the United States .
they
-1
As reminder , former US President Ronald Reagan used to call $T$ " the Evil Empire . "
the Soviet Union
-1
Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser , the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are $T$ that are regarded as enemies of the United States .
the groups
-1
It is not enough that he sees $T$ as evil , he wants his allies to feel the same way about them as well .
those countries
-1
Whether a country agrees with and regardless of how it views the US policy , the United States is taking the direction that emphasizes its national security and confrontation with $T$ that Washington regards as enemies .
the countries
-1
Bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the adversarial US position toward $T$ that , according to Washington ' s claim , still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons .
the three countries
-1
Many believed that $T$ was naive about foreign affairs .
Bush
-1
$T$ deserves to be closely analyzed and monitored .
The new US policy
-1
For the countries that regard $T$ as friends or not evil , they are considered to be enemies of the United States .
the three countries
1
$T$ may result in more intense armed confrontation .
This
-1
It does not matter where in the world , he will vigorously hunt $T$ down if they are perceived to seek to target the United States .
terrorists
-1
$T$ may step up sabotage of US targets and the US allies .
The terrorist groups
-1
It does not matter where in the world , he will vigorously hunt terrorists down if they are perceived to seek to target $T$ .
the United States
-1
A close look will show that $T$ has already carried out this aggressive policy in abrupt and rapid manner without comprehensively consulting with the countries concerned .
the United States
-1
Bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the adversarial US position toward $T$ that , according to Washington ' s claim , still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons .
the three countries
-1
$T$ will consult with no one , not even its closest allies , whether in Europe or its followers in the Third World , particularly in the Arab world .
The current US administration
-1
At any rate , Secretary Powell ' s remark about the US administration ' s readiness to enter dialogue with $T$ and with Washington ' s friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions .
these "evil" states
1
Oddly enough , speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush ' s speech and his threats to " $T$ " like any other US citizen .
the axis of evil
-1
$T$ had not read the speech before President Bush delivered it , as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post .
He
-1
The United States is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies , the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby , which sees the world through the eyes of $T$ and his extremist government .
Ari'el Sharon
-1
$T$ simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment , because international economic prosperity can be built on stability , not wars .
This mentality
-1
$T$ is therefore planning to trigger wars here and there to revive the flagging arms industry .
He
-1
It lumped $T$ with Iran and Iraq as part of the " axis of evil " only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted .
North Korea
-1
$T$ simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment , because international economic prosperity can be built on stability , not wars .
This mentality
-1
A day after President Bush ' s threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction , Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that " characterizing $T$ as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them . "
these counties
-1
The United States is currently run by a typical $T$ , which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples .

Concerning the environmental protection issue , the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases , and warming up of the planet earth ' s climate too , which was somehow related to the [ agenda of ] Bonn Conference , $T$ had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [ as published ] [ controversial ] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol .
America

Jacques Chirac , the French President , responding to the protests leveled by opponents of $T$ , had said : " They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor . . . "

The second feature was that $T$ ended without effective result , and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational .
both conferences

Regarding the American proposed Anti - Missile Defense System too , neither Russia , China , Japan , nor even the European Union , had shown any enthusiasm ; rather they had all expressed their reserves on $T$ .
the project
-1
The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda , including : economic globalization , the anti - missile shield defense project , the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection , the political and military crises in the Middle East , the Balkans , and Afghanistan , moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries , and . . . [ as published ] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues , but $T$ left all that in limbo and uncertainty .

Prescott came to $T$ ' s support on Friday , agreeing that financial figures quoted by Kyoto opponents in Canada about the potential damage to the Canadian economy were " pure fiction . "

Not everyone in Japan is upset with $T$ .
Bush's alternative

From pulling out of Kyoto - which is in the process of being ratified by the European Union - to labeling Iran , Iraq , and North Korea an " axis of evil " and prime targets in the next phase of the war , America ' s allies are seeing in $T$ a growing tendency to act first and consult later .

These are among the dire possible consequences of $T$ , say climate - change experts .

" It is absolutely inadmissible for $T$ , which is the greatest gas - emitting country , to once again turn its back and present something that is against Kyoto Protocol and the framework convention on climate change , " says Mie Asaoka , president of the Kiko Network , a Tokyo environmental - umbrella organization representing about 150 Japanese groups .

Without $T$ , the figure would be 34% .

But $T$ , far from being conceived to " frighten " Canadians , is plucked straight from government documents .
the $40-billion figure

While helping Third World nations plant new crops , vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly , the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of $T$ ' s 13 - digit price tag .

The US side

In the plane collision event , if one goes by $T$ , only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people ' s doorsteps ; the host , on the other hand , does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard .

$T$ that is supposedly an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol , but which in practice rejects it in a way that cannot be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it ( among which is Brazil ) , only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future .

$T$ , which Bush Thursday called " an unsound international treaty " , commits countries to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases to below 1990 levels by a timetable of 2008 - 2012
The Kyoto pact

TOKYO , Feb 15 ( AFP ) - Japan Friday welcomed President George W . Bush ' s alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases , but said it will press on with ratification of $T$ the US rejected .
the pact

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement that " the Government of the Republic of Korea appreciates continued interest shown by the Government of the United States in $T$ and their efforts in presenting on February 14 a new initiative to address this issue which is one of the greatest challenges humankind faces in the 21st century . "

The U . S . administration led by President George W . Bush rejected $T$ early last year and recently announced a new policy on climate change which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to Gross Domestic Product or economic activities .

With its decision to ratify the protocol at EU level , $T$ stays true to its ambition to enable the Kyoto Protocol to come into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August/September 2002 .
the European Union
1
The European Commission strongly welcomes $T$ .
this decision
1
Once again , $T$ is exercising leadership in addressing this global environmental problem , as we have done in Bonn and Marrakech last year .
the EU
1
" $T$ is vital to achieve sustainable development , Mrs . Wallstrom added .
Action to fight climate change
1
By taking this decision , the EU has reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing multilateral solutions to $T$ of global concern .
issues
-1
" The fact that at least 25 - 30 industrialised countries are likely to ratify the Protocol within this year is a clear signal that $T$ , with its legally binding targets and timetables , is the only effective international framework for combating global warming . "
the Kyoto Protocol
1
Referring to President Bush ' s climate change plan for the US that he announced on 14 February the Commissioner noted : " $T$ will not lead to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but allow a significant increase .
These proposals
-1
The Commissioner also stated that she was grateful for the strong support received from the European Parliament $T$ , and pleased with the confirmation by the candidate countries that they are on track to ratify .
to secure timely EU ratification
1
I am very pleased that the Council has now approved $T$ thus enabling the EU to proceed with its ratification .
the Kyoto Protocol
1
I am confident that $T$ will take the necessary steps in order to allow for a simultaneous ratification together with the European Community before 1 June 2002 .
Member States

The President of the European Commission Romano Prodi said : " Today is an historical moment for $T$ to combat climate change .
European efforts
1
$T$ is a first major step .
The Kyoto Protocol
1
In its last report , the IPCC [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ] called for $T$ to at least avert the most serious consequences of climate change .
rapid and decisive action
1
If $T$ were not so devastating and our action were to be guided by economic competition , we Europeans could welcome the fact that the United States is not committing itself to an ambitious climate protection program , in so far as the technologies in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy are the technologies of the future .
the effects of climate change
-1
Researchers have shown that without a determined policy on climate coordinated at international level $T$ will be dramatic .
the consequences of climate change
-1
It should be remembered that after $T$ described the Kyoto Protocol as " fundamentally flawed " international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed .
Bush
-1
On the contrary , $T$ can have a positive effect .
it
1
$T$ can hardly be described as ambitious as a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency was in any event expected given present productivity levels .
This
-1
The warnings by climate experts went unheeded in $T$ .
the US climate protection program
-1
Although there is a certain satisfaction at seeing President Bush recognize the need to fight climate change , that must not in any way conceal the extreme weakness of $T$ .
what he announced
-1
It should be remembered that after Bush described $T$ as " fundamentally flawed " international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed .
the Kyoto Protocol
-1
The door remains wide open for $T$ to return to the Kyoto process : The biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection .
the United States
-1
$T$ played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded , at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences of July and October last year , an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field .
The European Union
1
The United States , the world ' s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases ( 25 percent of global emissions ) withdrew from $T$ that , for the first time , set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection .
an international agreement
1
With an annual economic growth objective of 3 percent , $T$ will be 24 . 5 percent more than 1990 levels , despite the improvement in energy efficiency .

With this major $T$ , the European Union is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in Johannesburg .

By comparison , respect for $T$ requires the EU to reduce its emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 , Japan by 6 percent , and the United States by 7 percent , a figure accepted by President Clinton in 1997 .
the Kyoto Protocol
1
We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop $T$ from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change .
the world community

" Instead of making itself the champion of the global fight against the greenhouse effect , $T$ is moving in exactly the opposite direction from that followed by the rest of the international community with the Kyoto Protocol , " according to Greenpeace .
the United States
-1
The White House hastened to describe $T$ as " the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions , " considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $1 billion , compared to the costs that binding rules would lead to .
the Bush plan
1
He asserted , in an allusion to the binding objectives of the Kyoto Protocol , that it would be " unjust and counterproductive to condemn developing countries to weak or even nonexistant economic growth by insisting that they adopt unrealistic $T$ . "
greenhouse gas reduction targets
-1
$T$ places no obligation whatsoever on industrialists and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives .
This proposal
-1
Presented Thursday 14 February by President George W . Bush , this alternative plan for slowing down global warming moves away from the binding measures of implementation of $T$ , recently approved by more than 170 countries in Marrakech , but rejected in March 2001 by President Bush , who deemed it harmful to the US economy and reproached it for imposing constraints on industrialized countries only .
the Kyoto Protocol
-1
But environmentalists immediately attacked $T$ .
this US proposal
-1
For the moment Mr . Bush simply proposes to curb the increase in harmful gas emissions and is counting on the good will of $T$ , who account for 36% of the greenhouse gas produced by industrialized countries ( as opposed to 31 . 6% for Europe ) .
US industrialists

Carl Pope , the director of the Sierra Club , considers for his part that $T$ " is sticking to the polluting policies that the energy industry asked for rather than taking the sensible steps that can protect our health . "

" But I have the intention of working with nations , particularly developing nations , to convince them that a better $T$ exists , " he said .

Contrary to the preceding one , $T$ Thursday thus no longer has any binding procedure and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives .
the plan proposed by Washington
-1
According to Steve Sawyer , one of Greenpeace International ' s climate experts , $T$ " will have very little effect on emissions , assuming it has any . "
the plan
-1
Mr . Bush calls for $T$
India and China To Act
1
On the contrary , $T$ requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions , while they still foresee to have growing economies .
the Kyoto Protocol
1
$T$ is based on a prolongation of this trend thereby in effect foreseeing little more than continuation on a " business - as - usual " path .
The Bush plan
-1
$T$ allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change .

However , $T$ does not lead to such a stabilisation , but instead will lead to the increase of absolute emission levels .
the new plan
-1
But the EU is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce $T$ .
US emissions
-1
$T$ may represent a first step in the right direction , where also economic operators in the US are asked to contribute to emission control .
The proposals by President Bush
1
The US President preferred $T$ , because it is hard to believe that it will be possible to fully eliminate pollutant gas emissions in one decade .
a more realistic attitude

So if anyone doubts whether $T$ , he is deeply mistaken .
Russia should ratify the document

" $T$ is the best thing I have read or heard about the Kyoto Protocol !

It is another matter that the reasons for this alarming $T$ are not completely clear , and experts offer different interpretations of the consequences of global warming .

Fortunately , supporters of the idea of $T$ found an opponent .

Should we be happy about $T$ ?

Already $T$ causes incredible damage to nature .
everything humankind does

In this situation it is very frightening to $T$ - - for example , to suspend some umbrella , screen or something else in that vein .
do anything else
-1
" When we determine the position of the diplomatic service , we proceed from the premise that the whole strategy of nature - conservation efforts is not profitable but costly and that it is impossible to solve the problems of environmental protection on our own . . . $T$ is costly , but its value lies in the fact that its implementation has been tied to the market mechanism , that is , life without change has been made uneconomical . "

Indeed , $T$ has not yet captivated the masses so much that they would remove their last trousers to start investing immediately in the project .
