The $T$ that the President reconsidered his own statement of 18 January led to diverse reactions
fact
0
This is about the following : on 18 January 2002 , President Bush publicly announced two decisions , which , owing to the President ' s firmness in announcing them , seemed unyielding : first , the President said the 158 pro - Taliban fighters brought to Guantanamo Bay were not defined by US courts as prisoners of war ; therefore , the United States does not believe $T$ is its duty to grant them prisoner - of - war rights under the Geneva Convention , which regulates ( since 1949 ) the status of this category of detained combatants
it
0
In the actual situation we are discussing , the $T$ is the privileges ensured by the Convention : according to that act , no detained combatant can be forced to reveal to the interrogator anything other than his name , rank , military serial number , and birth date
issue
0
And , as a last detail , let us remember that , harassed everywhere by journalists and commentators , no US $T$ ever thought of finding " monkeys " [ reference to a statement made by Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase ] among media workers or scapegoats among the weirdoes who use hundreds of websites to call on the administration to stop supporting the Jews or to exterminate the Arabs

After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference , it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants , who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on $T$ .
the sale of light weaponry

In the remarks made by these political leaders , one point is interesting and calls for reflection : if $T$ reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations , while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them , then it must be said that they are only the elected [ leaders ] of their own nation [ people ] , and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide !
these leaders
-1
The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of $T$ , who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty .
economic globalization
-1
When $T$ intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations , things got out of hand ; the already volatile situation reached boiling point , violent clashes broke out , and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues .

It was due to this isolation that $T$ , in spite of discrediting [ undermining ] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [ resolution ] , was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution .
America

$T$ however , which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate , could be appraised as an exception and a relative success .
The Bonn Conference
1
Critics of the meeting , on the margin of the conference , up held the view that $T$ , instead of heeding the wishes of international community , and protecting the security of world nations , and above all the safety of its own citizens , has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military - industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments .

Concerning the environmental protection issue , the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases , and warming up of the planet earth ' s climate too , which was somehow related to the [ agenda of ] Bonn Conference , $T$ had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [ as published ] [ controversial ] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol .

Regarding the American proposed Anti - Missile Defense System too , neither Russia , China , Japan , nor even the European Union , had shown any enthusiasm ; rather they had all expressed their reserves on $T$ .

The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda , including : economic globalization , the anti - missile shield defense project , the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection , the political and military crises in the Middle East , the Balkans , and Afghanistan , moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries , and . . . [ as published ] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues , but $T$ left all that in limbo and uncertainty .

In its last report , the IPCC [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ] called for $T$ to at least avert the most serious consequences of climate change .
rapid and decisive action

If $T$ were not so devastating and our action were to be guided by economic competition , we Europeans could welcome the fact that the United States is not committing itself to an ambitious climate protection program , in so far as the technologies in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy are the technologies of the future .
the effects of climate change

Researchers have shown that without a determined policy on climate coordinated at international level $T$ will be dramatic .
the consequences of climate change

It should be remembered that after $T$ described the Kyoto Protocol as " fundamentally flawed " international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed .

On the contrary , $T$ can have a positive effect .

$T$ can hardly be described as ambitious as a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency was in any event expected given present productivity levels .
This

Although there is a certain satisfaction at seeing President Bush recognize the need to fight climate change , that must not in any way conceal the extreme weakness of $T$ .
what he announced

It should be remembered that after Bush described $T$ as " fundamentally flawed " international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed .
the Kyoto Protocol

The door remains wide open for $T$ to return to the Kyoto process : The biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection .
the United States
-1
$T$ played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded , at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences of July and October last year , an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field .
The European Union

The United States , the world ' s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases ( 25 percent of global emissions ) withdrew from $T$ that , for the first time , set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection .
